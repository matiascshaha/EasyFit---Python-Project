# EasyFit---Python-Project
CIS4930 Group Project: EasyFit

The goal of this project is to help the user attain their weight loss or weight gain goal by giving them a tailored workout plan and diet. This is done by receiving user input about their weight, goals, and other details in a pop up window and calculating that data in python files that display a database. In order to display the database, you must first run setup.py. If you need to delete the database delete database.db and then run setup.py again. The libraries and modules used in this project are sqlite3, QtWidgets, subprocess, os, platform, and sys. There were multiple instances when people worked on more than a few specific parts or helped each other with their assigned part. In general, Michael worked on the database aspect, Matias worked on the person and diet file, Abigail worked on the workout and Readme,  Ryan worked on the EasyFit and workout file and testing, and Tristian worked on the interface and driver file.
